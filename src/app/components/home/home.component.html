  <p>NEW RELEASE</p>
  <p>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</p>
  <p>It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. In
    the Capital, eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory
    as a mentor in the Games. The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times,
    its fate hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus will be able to outcharm,
    outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute.
